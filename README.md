# Sunshine or Showers

## A web application to help you plan your work day!
A fun html and javascript based weather app to get the weather information of anywhere in the world over for up to five days.

### What was my motivation?
To create a very useful weather app that can tell you in an instant what weather to expect and therefore what clothes to wear for the next five days. It was very important to include no adds and be very resource light so can be launched from any device.

### What did I do?
Started layer by layer with the html, then the css and finally the javascript to include all necessary functionality

### What did I learn?
The absolute importance of reading the api documentation to ensure you are using the api correctly with the functionality that you want to include.   

## Usage.

To use the application follow the link and be sure to enter the city/region you want to find weather information on. You can also click on the previous searches to reload that particular weather information.
